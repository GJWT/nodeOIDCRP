OpenID Connect Relying Party
<pre>
Introduction<pre>
Imaging that you have a web service where some of the functions that service provides are 
protected and should only be accessible to authenticated users or that some of the functions 
the service provides needs access to some user related resources on a resource server. That’s
when you need OpenID Connect (OIDC) or Oauth2.
<pre>
The RPHandler as implemented in RPHandler is a service within the web service that
handles user authentication and access authorization on behalf of the web service.
<pre>
Some background<pre>
In the following description I will talk about Relying Party (RP) and OpenID Connect Provider 
(OP)but I could have talked about Oauth2 Client and OAuth2 Authorization Server instead. There 
are some differences in the details between the two sets but overall the entities work much the
same way.
<pre>
OAuth2 and thereby OpenID Connect (OIDC) are build on a request-response paradigm. The RP issues 
a request and the OP returns a response.
<pre>
The OIDC core standard defines a set of such request-responses. This is a basic list of 
request-responses and the normal sequence in which they occur:<pre>
Provider discovery (WebFinger) <pre>
Provider Info Discovery<pre>
Client registration <pre>
Authorization/Authentication <pre>
Access token <pre>
User info <pre>
<pre>
When a user accessing the web service for some reason needs to be authenticate or the service 
needs a access token that allows it to access some resources at a resource service on behalf of
the user a number of things will happen:
<pre>
Find out which OP to talk to :<pre>
If the RP handler is configured to only communicate to a defined set of OPs then the user is 
probably presented a list to chose from. If the OP the user wants to authenticated at is unknown 
to the RP Handler it will use some discovery service to, given some information provided by the 
user, find out where to learn more about the OP.<pre>
<pre>
Gather information about the OP :<pre>
This can be done out-of-band in which case the administrator of the service has gathered the 
information by contacting the administrator of the OP. In most cases this is done by reading the
necessary information on a web page provided by the organization responsible for the OP. One can
also chose to gather the information on-the-fly by using the provider info discovery service 
provided by OIDC.<pre>
<pre>
Register the client with the OP :<pre>
Again this can be done beforehand or it can be done on-the-fly when needed. If it’s done before 
you will have to use a registration service provided by the organization responsible for the OP.
If it’s to be done on-the-fly you will have to use the dynamic client registration service OIDC 
provides.<pre>
<pre>
Authentication/Authorization :<pre>
This is done by the user at the OP.
<pre>
What happens after this depends on which response_type is used. If the response_type is code then 
the following step is done:
<pre>
Access token request : 
Base on the information received in the authorization response a request for an access token is
made to the OP. 
<pre>
And if the web service wants user information it might also have to do:
<pre>
Obtain user info
Using the access token received above a userinfo request will be sent to the OP.
<pre>
Which of the above listed services that your RP will use when talking to an OP are usually 
decided by the OP. Just to show you how it can differ between different OPs I’ll give you a 
couple of examples below:
<pre>
Google : <pre>
If you want to use the Google OP as authentication service you should know that it is a true OIDC
OP certified by the OpenID Foundation. You will have to manually register you RP at Google but 
getting Provider info can be done dynamically using an OIDC service. With Google you will use the
response_type code. This means that you will need services 2,4,5 and 6 from the list above. More 
about how you will accomplish this below
<pre>
Microsoft :<pre>
Microsoft have chosen to only support response_type id_token and to return all the user 
information in the id_token. Microsoft’s OP supports dynamic Provider info discovery but client 
registration is done manual. What it comes down to is that you will only need services 2 and 4.
<pre>
Github : <pre>
Now, to begin with Github is not running an OP they basically have an Oauth2 AS with some 
additions. It doesn’t support dynamic provider info discovery or client registration. If expects 
response_type to be code so services 4,5 and 6 are needed.
